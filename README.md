# Airbnb-Bookings-Analysis---Capstone-Project


### Objective:
In this project, I will perform a descriptive and exploratory analysis of the data, in order to understand how the phenomena of each variable behave individually and transversely, in addition to to generate hypotheses useful for future decision-making . The whole analysis will follow a simple and direct structure, well detailed in all topics, aiming at the same time, to create an intuitive and simple guide of which steps must be followed to carry out a good analysis, to in order to understand the data involved in any study.

  ### Method:
To perform this work, I will use statistical techniques very common in any type of analysis, simple or complex, such as classification of variables, frequency distribution tables, histograms, measures of central tendency and etc. Initial steps involve reading the file, basic exploration of data description, statistical description of data, univariate and multivariate visualization.
